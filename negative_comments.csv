The ""cloud"" is just someone else's computer. They make the rules, which are usually driven by maximizing shareholder value and minimizing cost. 

Everyone insisted you create an account, whether it makes sense for the use cases or not, and move all your info onto their cloud. Then they reserve the right to scrutinize it with their automated systems and remove privileges, cut you off, and/or share data with authorities at their discretion.

Ultimately the convenience of ""access anywhere"" carries too much inconvenience and danger.

Sorry to soapbox here, your story is altogether too common, and the only solution is to keep control of your data, and backup the (legitimately) cloud data early and often.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Pinterest/comments/16wcdlq/well_its_over_they_really_dont_care_about_us_at/

Much, much worse than that, several brides posted on line that they had all their Christmas wedding material on it with no access. It still makes me sick just to think about it.

You can use ctrl+a on a Pinterest page/board to get all the images at once, but it will select additional text boxes and other misc. content.

Reddit is the only place on the vast wasteland the Internet has become for sharing facts about horrible platforms like Pinterest.

It is not all bad.  -It is great for getting you via images to things you are interested in.

But even this they can't keep working properly...  All of a sudden last week videos no longer play on Pinterest! -None of them!! -Regardless of browser!

Every big platform does stupid things like create huge bugs when they update that never get fixed, even after years. (Youtube)!

But for bafflingly stupid interface fails that they seem to introduce constantly, there is no match for Pinterest, especially if you are dumb enough to try to create Pins there.

It would take me all day to enumerate the long list of these I've encountered over the years.

Instead I will just describe the latest outrage:

An alert suddenly popped up today that locked me from getting in to Pinterest until I gave it my ""birthdate"".

In my Oculus browser I was totally unable to access the box I was supposed to enter this into at all!

But wait, there's more!...

So I tried to get in to my Pinterest pages in Chrome now...

I could get a date into their stupid box, but ONLY by clicking backwards on the month from November 2023 until I got way back to my birth year!! I am 69, so this took 69 x 12 = 828 clicks!! It required ten minutes, and my finger was numb from all these back clicks!!!

Then throw in the fact half the Pinterest links are dead. The platform apparently has no way to keep anything up to date in the system.

 Not only the stupid AI is reporting every photo of the male chest or female clavicle, but also another user is making a vendetta against me. They were reporting all my public boards and pins every day for some absurd reasons like promoting violence or selling weapons/drugs.  
When I made all my boards private, they started reporting now my profile. 
These reports from that person are triggering the AI, which is targeting my profile more because it was reported, and it flagged even totally empty boards as self-harm. 

I suspect it's a person who copied my poems and quotes and I assume I reported them for copyright issues. I have information under every pin ""Please do not copy"", still, people are ignoring it. 

I can see in the Center of Reports the information if I was reported by a bot or another user. 
If you live in Europe, you can see your reported pins in the Center of Reports in the profile settings. I recommend checking it, it's helpful. 

Pinterest has been a hobby for me, but now it's not a pleasure, but a source of stress.

Pinterest isn’t banning ‘white girls’; it’s about making the platform more inclusive and correcting a historical overrepresentation. 

Also when I search black girl, a majority of the posts showing up is linked to a website, be it a product page or blog. It's very likely keywords in the backend are what is driving this. Edited to add, I doubt anyone in a marketing department is adding white girl to any tags or list of words. Pinterest is a search engine platform and keywords are what we use to drive traffic. People typically talk about targeting the black market and other demos to build personas. But white has never been included in a white person's persona.

Most likely, the only way for this to work would be to encourage/force people to tag their pins correctly as AI - otherwise, the algorithm won't be able to tell the difference. And users won't be willing to tag their images as AI, if it means that they will have less engagement.

I just want to look at references and actual art and photography - many things AI depicts are just wrong or make no sense. Horrible for poses and clothing and buildings and anything really. And the misinformation it spreads not just about historical events, but clothing and cultures is awful. 
It's so disappointing to see an interesting thumbnail, only to open it and see the hands growing out of hands, clothing fusing with skin, recreations of buildings that pretend to be real places but they couldn't exist...
Currently, there is this phantom.painting AI-user whose gothic AI content is being spread all over pinterest. I'm looking for actual paintings, not this nightmare.

-0.08601851851851851,1,"They pulled this on one of my private, secret boards. (Removed it.) Which according to their own site, secret boards are totally private. But they removed my secret board that was called something related to absolutely nothing that could possibly peak an interest. I had to wonder how anyone at Pinterest would know to remove the board unless they viewed the board, which is secret/private. Imagine having private boards of pins that you collect for various reasons and having some random stranger reviewing your private boards without your knowledge. There are a million reasons people might want to keep a board private. And members to Pinterest apparently wrongly assume nobody can or would ever view those boards. So when Pinterest removed one of my private boards, I was quite shocked. I then clicked the appeal button to go off on Pinterest for violating my privacy, because that's the only way they could possibly know my private board had a collection of hunky shirtless men. Note, every pin was something Pinterest put into my timeline, that I then saved over to this private collection. I realize telling everyone about a private collection of shirtless hunk images is making it not private, but you all understand my point. Things are private for a reason. After I clicked the appeal button and realized I couldn't complain about any of this happening, that it just said someone would review my appeal within 7 days, I thought that was probably the end of the story. Because even if you could get a person to complain to, they would say Pinterest is for ""inspirational"" images only. But who is Pinterest to make a judgment about anything I'm doing in a private, secret group. Because they shouldn't be viewing it in the first place. Their website literally says ""Only you (and anyone you invite) can see your secret boards. Secret Pins and boards will not appear in your home feed, in search, or anywhere else around Pinterest."" A couple days later, my secret board was re-instated. Which brings me back to the original question, how did they know it could be re-instated? Did a second person review my secret group a second time? Or did someone blindly think ""Oh this should be fine, whatever is in here, so I'll re-instate it."" It's a little disturbing and basically everything you do on a computer could potentially be reviewed by other people with malicious intent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Pinterest/comments/1baqmha/nudity_policy_re_art/

I’ve always been a bit paranoid and chronically need to save things. Im not very trusting of using the internet for this because it’s so transient and intangible. I have been trusting of Pinterest, though.   
it’s hard not too with how the interphase was and its accessibility and being introduced to it by my art teacher a decade ago when I was a young teen.  
the app was different then, nudity wasn’t taboo, people posted adult fanart, but you would have to search for it and it usually never got on the algorithm. It was basically the perfect crutch for me to put my references in one place and not have to data hoard and overwhelm myself.  
  I have memory problems from depression and anxiety and I need apps and notebooks to aid me and for future reference.  
it helped with any obsessive compulsions and fear of loss I would get  knowing my information is safe and I didn’t have to worry about it.  
these types of things set me off and I do get unwanted thoughts and ruminating because my brain can’t comprehend the weight of the loss and what that means for me.

Limited distribution translates to we are not letting your pin be seen on our public stream.they don’t remove it they just don’t let every one in the world see it on home feed.

its your page. It’s their feed. It’s the correct balance.

now deactivation is a direct hammer and they are usually standing their ground on those.

I know this, because I was always very careful about following guidelines. I still have a screenshot of the old guidelines. It's stated that posts that suggest pornographic content are not allowed. Now, it says that any photo of the human body, even clothed, is not allowed. That is a HUGE difference. I uploaded aesthetic edits of my OCs on Pinterest, so it's perfectly normal that I uploaded photos of people. It was allowed and I did it for years. I had a lot of followers. 

It's a sad joke that they banned me for something I uploaded before they changed their stupid guidelines.

I may be wrong about this but if you have a business account they may be willing to at least forward appeals re bot-removed pins and/or suspension to a live person. If you don’t have a business account, consider changing your account to biz when it is re-instated.

My advice is to [appeal](https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/account-suspension) your head off.

You just have to keep appealing. Unless you have a multitude of truly terrible pins, I can’t see that they will not reinstate your account. If you did have monstrous pins then maybe opening a new account may be worth considering… and make it a business account because I believe that it makes a difference with the powers that be at Pinterest.

I mean, they may just be worried that Pinterest is turning into another unhinged tumblr – with crazy full-throttle porn and bizarre (scary) images. Maybe they’re just trying to nip it in the bud. Who knows? Good luck.

Basically every way to interact with Pinterest besides refreshing the homefeed and saving pins from there got restricted. Which sucks because the homefeed is pretty terrible (ads, off topic random pins, exact copies of the same picture but uploaded by someone different).

It makes me frustrated, scared for my account and manages to create just an un-safe feeling. I hate that when saving a completely unproblematic pin I have to be stressed about what the bots will possibly make of it.

One of my favourite ""adult content"" pin they took out was a picture of a mere moody nook of a book store – no humans, just some shelves and books. That one they gave back.

After worrying and stressing I am eventually becoming just tired of getting these emails and notifications about saved pictures that are absolutely decent content.
I'd obviously be devastated to lose my account because of this unfathomable route pinterest is having.
I am committed to obeying the rules and I want to obey them, too. But seems I keep not understanding them the same way pinterest does – makes using the platform impossible.

I do make a counter complaint when I think pinterest is wrong about their decision (and I'd recommend doing so; maybe they'll realize sooner their bots are not working like they should – if they actually care), but sometimes they stick to a decision I absolutely do not agree on.

It feels censorship in a way that does not change the app into a safer environment. Who are they ""protecting""?

""We recently removed one of your Pins due to violation of our guidelines on self-injury and harmful behaviour\*. After a review of our decision, we've decided to reinstate your Pin, but please take some time to go through your Pins and remove any that may be in violation of our Community Guidelines.  


These rules apply to all Pins, including Pins on your secret boards. If we notice more Pins that conflict with our Community Guidelines, we may take additional action on your account. ""

 \*never saved a pin related to that btw  


So they're basically telling me they removed the pin, then went back on that decision, but then they're warning me that they will take additional action on my account, just so we're clear that it's my fault either way I guess. What's even weirder is, my account is fairly old, and I used to get similar e-mails but worded very differently for a similar matter:  


""Subject: Sorry, we had to delete one of your Pins on Pinterest  


We're getting in touch to let you know that we received a copyright complaint and have removed one (or more) of your Pins. The complaint wasn't directed at you or your Pin. It was directed at another user's Pin of the same content from... (pin info, screenshot of the removed pin, etc.)  


...Again, this complaint was not directed at you or anything you did. We just thought you'd like to know why we removed your Pin.  
Thanks again for using Pinterest. ""  


This is an e-mail from 2017, which was obviously a while ago, and it's related to copyright rather than banned content, but it's still peculiar to me that this e-mail has such a drastic difference in tone from the ones I'm being bombarded with.

I've used Pinterest for maybe 10 years now and I don't think it used to happen, at least not often enough for me to take any notice.

So irritating to find a great pin on my feed and save, only to go back to my boards later, click on it to enlarge in the hopes of using it as a reference for art ect, and a completely unrelated video start playing??? 

For example, I pinned this pic of a model wearing a chain metal bag that was cool, I click on it in the hopes of finding the seller only for 'Louie Tomlinson - Holding onto Heartbreak' YouTube music video to start playing????

It was like all the pins were frozen in place. I can't move and organize my sub boards as well, for the same reason. I can add new pins and move pins from one board to another or to sub boards, but I cannot do the whole drag and drop thing where you can move the actual pins within the boards themselves. They are all stuck, frozen in place. This bug was happening a LOT last year, and they solved it but now it's back and worse than it was before! It is quite tiresome... ESPECIALLY when you are in the middle of using the site and it flips out like this. I tried clearing out my browser, I tried logging in using a different browser, and I even tried the desktop app, and the same problem happened across all of that! So, it's a problem with the site again, the same old problem they can't seem to keep fixed. You'd think they'd know how to fix it by now! Ugh.

I am not exactly sure what you mean about moving off screen. I can pick the pin up and start to drag it but any pins it slid off start to madly flicker. It will be partially off screen just in the act of swinging it, but comes back on screen when I drag it right or left.
